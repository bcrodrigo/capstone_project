According to the BC government[^1], about 40% of forest fires are reported by the general public, in addition to other detection strategies such as:
- Air patrols
- Fire warden ground patrols
- Infrared technology
- Computer technology and predictive software
- Lookout towers

If not detected and managed early on, forest fires can become a very destructive event that impacts both remote communities and large urban centres alike. Considering the vastness of the territory in the province of BC and the low population density, it's not possible to have people in remote areas constantly monitoring, but rather autonomous vehicles (drones), satellite imagery, and optical systems. With the latter, there is an opportunity to use Deep Learning (DL) models for image classification and segmentation to enable early automated detection of fires. Some authors have reported 95% accuracy scores for DL models classifying forest fire images[^2].

Having reliable automated and early detection of fires can impact the response time and management before they become too large to control. This ensures safety for those living in immediate proximity, as well as the firefighter crews. Additionally, the financial burden on taxpayers overall could be reduced. Last year (2023) was the worst fire seasons on record, resulting in an overbudget of > $700 M for the provincial government in BC[^3].
